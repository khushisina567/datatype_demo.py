# Task 2 – Variables, Data Types & Type Conversion
### Python Developer Internship – MSME

This project demonstrates the use of Python variables, data types, type conversion, error handling, and dynamic typing based on the internship assignment (Task 2).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This task includes:

- Declaring variables (int, float, string, boolean)
- Checking data types using `type()`
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Type casting (string → int, string → float)
- Handling invalid input using try-except
- Concatenating strings with numbers properly
- Demonstrating dynamic typing in Python
- Writing clean, well-commented code

## 📝 Sample Output

Type of int_var: <class 'int'>
Type of float_var: <class 'float'>
Type of string_var: <class 'str'>
Type of bool_var: <class 'bool'>

Arithmetic Operations:
Addition: 15.75
Multiplication: 57.5

Type Casting:
Converted to int: 42
Converted to float: 42.0

Dynamic Typing Example:
x = 100 → <class 'int'>
x = Python → <class 'str'>

## 💡 Interview Questions & Answers

### What is dynamic typing?
Python assigns variable types at runtime. A variable can change its type anytime.

### Difference between int and float?
- int → whole numbers  
- float → decimal numbers

### Why is type conversion required?
Because user input and file data usually come as strings.

### What happens if conversion fails?
Python raises a **ValueError** (handled using try-except).

### How does Python store variables?
Values are stored as objects.  
Variables are references pointing to those objects.
